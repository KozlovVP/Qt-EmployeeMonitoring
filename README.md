# Qt-EmployeeMonitoring
This app allows the employer to:
* Get screenshot from worker's computer at any time
* Start chat with a worker
* Make a task list for each worker
  
This app allows the worker to:
* See tasks given by the employer
* Start chat with the employer

## Tech side
By starting the "Coffee_boss" the employer starts server to which workers can connect. If the server isn't started, worker's app waits and autoconnects when the server is available
